Unique Vision develops and provides the Beluga series of SNS marketing tools for companies to connect with consumers, supporting over 800 SNS campaigns (Twitter, LINE, Instagram) per year. In order to ensure highly productive development in the rapidly changing SNS marketing industry, we have adopted Vue for almost all of our products since 2018. Currently, we are also focusing on converting existing products to Vue3, including adopting the vite+Vue3 configuration for new products and migrating products consisting of 800 components written in Vue2 to Vue3.
We have been and will continue to develop in Vue.

CloudSign is a contract management platform that digitally completes everything from contract signing to management. Vue.js has been used since the early days of the service and has supported the product for many years. This year's event will be held offline, which we have been looking forward to for a long time. We at Crowdsign are looking forward to working with the management and other participants to make the Vue.js community more active. We look forward to seeing you at the venue on the day of the event.

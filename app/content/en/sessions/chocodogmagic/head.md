We are developing a sample template in Nuxt 3 that can be used for Jamstack development of websites. We are developing this project with an emphasis on making it a generic structure that can be used for any project, so this is a different perspective from the common cases where each company has optimized their own structure.

Based on the experience of working on several Jamstack development projects using Nuxt 3, we will talk about how to implement common website content and how to make it a generic structure. This talk will be presented along with actual working code for those who want to smoothly launch a new project or for those who have difficulty creating similar configurations over and over again for contracted projects.

What we will talk about

- What is Jamstack development for websites these days
- The minimum necessary functions commonly found in a website
- How to make it versatile
- Sample code of Jamstack template in Nuxt 3

Objectives

- New projects that need to be started quickly
- It's hard to create Jamstack from scratch for each client on a contract basis.
- I read the Nuxt documentation, but I don't know how to use it in a real project.
- I want to make a Jamstack template for Nuxt 3.

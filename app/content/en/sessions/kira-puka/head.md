At Memoraba LLC, to which I belong, we use Nuxt3 for multiple development projects, both contract and in-house.
We prefer to use Nuxt3 as a module so that we can reuse it, but I had an impression that it was quite difficult to use.

I looked at the Module Author Guide, which is an official guide,
I found that it is not as difficult as I thought. I was not sure if it would be as difficult as I thought,
I would like to introduce the contents of the guide with excerpts from the Module Author Guide.

I would like to introduce the contents of Module Author Guide as an excerpt from it,
I would be happy if you are interested in how to make modules.

Also, please understand that I have no experience in Nuxt2 module development,
I can't talk about the comparison of Nuxt2 module development.

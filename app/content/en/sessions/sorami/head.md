In this presentation, the current status and issues of 3D data visualization on the Web will be explained based on examples using Vue.js and CesiumJS in particular.

Using the "AIST 3DDB Client" provided by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) as a subject, the presentation will introduce points to be aware of when handling 3D data and tips for using data visualization and map libraries in Vue.js. This web app, which can display, search, and download a variety of 3D data, is available as open source software: https://github.com/aistairc/aist_3ddb_client

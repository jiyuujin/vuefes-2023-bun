Client-side routing, a method of controlling screen transitions on the browser side, is used to reduce the cognitive load of screen transitions by eliminating latency from the server and enabling smooth browsing.
Since Nuxt 3.4, smooth transition animations can be achieved by setting the experimental View Transitions API.

However, these methods need to be considered from an accessibility perspective to ensure that information is conveyed correctly.
In this session, we will introduce how information is conveyed during screen transitions and approaches to make Nuxt applications more accessible based on implementation examples.

We had an opportunity to implement a grid system using Vue when we were building our own design system, but the implementation of the grid system has been difficult to implement due to the problems with the CSS media query specification. I would like to talk about some of the grid system implementation patterns we considered and the ones we actually adopted, taking into account the merits and demerits of each.

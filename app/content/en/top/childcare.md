We have prepared childcare support so that fathers and mothers can concentrate and enjoy the conference. Vue Fes Japan will subsidize the actual cost of those who used some childcare service on the day (up to Â¥15,000).

- General ticket purchase is required in advance.
- Please apply for the childcare service you want to use by yourself.
- After applying, the Vue.js Japan User Group will contact you by email within 5 business days regardless of whether support is available or not.
- A receipt for the childcare service used on the day of the event (2023/10/28) is required.
- After the event, the money will be transferred to the designated bank account within about one month.
- Please note that registration will be closed for the first 20 people.

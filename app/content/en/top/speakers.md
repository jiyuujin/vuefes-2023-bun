Would you like to take the stage at Vue Fes Japan 2023?

Please share your unique knowledge and experience about Vue and its ecosystem at Japan's largest Vue.js conference.

At Vue Fes Japan 2023, in order to solicit speaker presentations from the general public, we will use the CFP (Call for Papers) system. The Vue Fes Japan 2023 staff will review it and adopt it as an official session.

We have prepared two presentation methods: a 30-minute presentation “Session” and a 5-minute “Lightning Talk (LT)”.

We are waiting for a hot announcement unique to everyone who loves Vue!

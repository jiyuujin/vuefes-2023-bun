At Vue Fes Japan 2023, we will conduct a hands-on (style of learning while actually writing code) where everyone who participates can experience Vue.js application development while moving their hands together.

Whether you are a beginner looking to learn Vue.js or an experienced user wanting to catch up on the new development methods of Vue 3, you can learn the basics of Vue.js in 2 hours. There will also be Q&A by Vue.js Japan User Group staffs.

Pre-registration is required to participate. When purchasing a general ticket, please apply for a hands-on ticket (free) together. Seats are limited and on a first-come, first-served basis, so register early!

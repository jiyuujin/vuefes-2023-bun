At Vue Fes Japan 2023, we will conduct a hands-on (style of learning while actually writing code) where everyone who participates can experience Vue.js application development while moving their hands together.

Whether you are a beginner looking to learn Vue.js or an experienced user wanting to catch up on the new development methods of Vue 3, you can learn the basics of Vue.js in 2 hours. There will also be Q&A by Vue.js Japan User Group staffs.

Please note that all hands-on tickets have sold out due to popular demand. Please note that attendance is limited to hands-on ticket holders only.

- When you participate, please prepare the development environment by referring to the link below.
